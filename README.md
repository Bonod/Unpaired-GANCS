# Unpaired-GANCS
This code implements the recovery of image x from the undersampled measurements y when the pair (x,y) is not avaialble for training. However, we know the images, say \tilde{x}, from another relevant image dataset that can guide us to recover the ground-truth x from y. This is important for medical imaging applications where usually one doesn't have access to high-resolution datastes for all organs.
